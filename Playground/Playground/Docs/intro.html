<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    Benoit Mandelbrot was the first mathmetician to extensively study and write about fractals;
    images that contain infinitely repeating patterns.  In particular, he was interested in fractals
    generated by <i>iterating functions</i>.  What this means is that Mandelbrot's fractals were generated
    by calculating a sequence of numbers for each point in the complex plane.  The sequence is defined
    by a simple function.  If the sequence is bounded for a particular starting point, then that point
    belongs to a set generated by the sequence.  Mandelbrot famously pointed out that to render his
    eponymous "Mandelbrot set", all you have to do is add and multiply; you don't even have to subtract
    or divide.  You just have to do it billions of times!  The odds are that if you're reading this,
    you're sitting in front of a machine capable of doing these calculations.
</p>

<p>
    See <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set'>Wikipedia</a> for more background about the
    Mandelbrot set fractal.  There is also an excellent PBS documentary about fractals, including an interview
    with the late Benoit Mandelbrot himself.  It's on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmxJ1KDR_s0'>YouTube</a>.
</p>

<p>
    While teaching myself HTML5 programming, I came across an example that shows how to use HTML5 to
    draw the Mandelbrot set fractal.  I was mesmerized by the complex images rendered by doing these
    simple, but extensive calculations and I set out to write my own software to render fractals.
</p>

<p>
    While the images are very beautiful, this program was originally written as a learning exercise or etude.

    <h2>Quick Start</h2>

    <p>
        The program is very easy to use.  <a href='../index.html' target="_blank">Launch Program in Browser!</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        When the program runs for the first time, it will attempt to determine the number of cores in your CPU.
        This is used to optimize the parallel calculations.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will see a progress bar as the program draws the Mandelbrot fractal.  Very beautiful, isn't it?
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the program has drawn a fractal, you can do several things.  You can select a different fractal to draw
        using the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.  You can also zoom in and see the infinite detail of the
        fractal, up to the limits of 64-bit computation.  There are two ways to zoom.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Click and drag to select a square shaped region.<br />Then, click the [Draw] button or press the [D] key on the keyboard.
            Note that this shortcut doesn't work when the Options Dialog is open.
        </li>
        <li>
            If using a touchscreen and a touch-compatible browser, simultaneously touch the two corners of the region to select.
            Touching a third spot while the two corners are still touched is a short-cut to zoom.
        </li>
    </ol>
</aside>

<h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>

<p>
    I hate to write notes about browser compatibility as if we are trapped in the late 90s.
    However, I want you to know that HTML5 Fractal Playground is optimized to use experimental features of the new version of Firefox for very fast calculations.
    Chrome should yield acceptable performance, as well.  However, this program runs very poorly in Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>
    This program also uses the W3C standard touch events.  I am using an experimental library to emulate these events in IE, which doesn't support them.
</p>


<h2>Operation</h2>

<p>
    The core functionality of HTML5 Fractal Playground is to draw fractal images defined by a generating
    function.  The function has two variables: z and c.  z refers to the previous element in the sequence
    and c refers to the first element of the sequence.  For example, in the sequence defined by f(z, c) = z ^ 2 + c,
    you would compute the sequence for the number 1 as follows<br />
    z<sub>0</sub> = 1<br />
    z<sub>1</sub> = z<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + c = 1<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2<br />
    z<sub>2</sub> = z<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c = 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 5<br />
    z<sub>3</sub> = z<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c = 5<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 26<br />
    As you can see, this sequence goes to infinity, so 1 would not be in this fractal set.
</p>

<p>
    HTML5 Fractal Playground provides many functions that can be used to define the iterating function.
    It provides the operators +, -, *, /, and ^.  Please note that a limitation of the current version
    of HTML5 Fractal Playground is that when a number is raised to a power, that power has to be a whole
    number.  In addition to the operators, the following functions are provided:
</p>
 
<p style='clear:both;'>    
        real: real number representing the real part of a complex number<br />
        imag: real number representing the imaginary part of a complex number<br />
        conj: the complex conjugate of a number<br />
        arg: the complex argument<br />
        sin: sine<br />
        cos: cosine<br />
        sh: hyperbolic sine<br />
        ch: hyperbolic cosine<br />
        exp: natural exponential<br />
        ln: natural log<br />
    
    Expanding the supported functions is in my plans for a future release.
</p>

<p>
    <b>You do not need to know anything about these functions</b> to draw beautiful fractals with HTML5 Fractal Playground.
    By default, you can simply select the iterating function from a list of functions known to generate beautiful fractals.
    The ability to specify your own iterating function is for power users.
</p>

</div>

<p>
    A major point of interest when it comes to fractals is that the amount of detail
    in the fractal is infinite.  No matter how big you draw the fractal, there is always more
    detail to be revealed by drawing bigger.
</p>

<p>
    To that end, HTML5 Fractal Playground allows you to zoom in on any fractal you draw with it.
    In order to zoom, simply draw a fractal and then use the mouse to highlight an area of the
    fractal and click the [Draw] button.  If your browser supports it, you can also select
    a region by touching the corners of the region on a touchscreen; you can trigger the
    zoom by touching a third point.
</p>

<p>
    The mathematics engine in HTML5 Fractal Playground will allow you to zoom quite far, but
    eventually, you will reach the limits of the precision supported by the program, and
    the images will pixelate.
</p>

<p>
    You can click the [Reset Plot Location] button to go back to the original fractal, or you
    can use the back and forward buttons in your browser.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, you can click the [Save] button to save any image rendered by HTML5 Fractal Playground
    on your local machine.

<h2>
    Known Issues
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        The hash URL syntax is experimental.  It should not be expected that hash URLs generated with the current version will work in future versions.
    </li>

    <li>
        The touch interface sometimes causes a context-menu to appear in Firefox.  I think that this may be a bug in Firefox.
